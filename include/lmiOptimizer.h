class Grasp;

//! Encapsulates the Grasp Force Optimization (GFO) code based on Linear Matrix Inequalitties (LMI)
/*! This class contains the first iteration of the GFO code from GraspIt
  release 0.9. This code is based on the linear matrix inequality
  technique and was adapted from code written by Li Han and Jeff Trinkle.
  More information regarding their algorithm can be found in: L. Han,
  J. Trinkle, and Z. Li, "Grasp Analysis as Linear Matrix Inequality
  Problems," \e IEEE \e Transactions \e on \e Robotics \e and \e
  Automation, Vol. 16, No. 6, pp. 663--674, December, 2000.

  Note that this functionality is complete, but it has not been throroughly
  used or tested. Is is also not completely documented, so you will have to
  read the code and figure it out. Unfortunately, it has fallen into disrepair
  and has not been kept up-to-date with the rest of GraspIt. As such, it is
  not used anywhere else, and probably will not work out of the box.

  We also have a new way of doing GFO based on Quadratic Programming (QP). That
  functionality is included with the Grasp class. It is up to date and tested.
  We recommend to use that version for your GFO code. The LMI version is
  probably superior from the mathematical standpoint, but the QP version is
  easier to follow, completely documented and up to date. A good starting
  point is the function Grasp::computeQuasistaticForcesAndTorques(...)

  Note that this file and this version of the GFO code might be removed from
  future releases of GraspIt.
