/*! This class is designed to perform interactive grasping tasks where
  GraspIt helps the user by planning grasps interactively. It uses a
  list of planned grasps (presumably by some planner) and knows which
  hand to shape.

  Planning good grasps is one thing; actually executing them is
  another. It's not enough to know a number of f-c grasps. You have to
  decide which one to choose, how to close the fingers gradually, etc.
  In this context you are also interacting with a human operator. You
  have to decide which grasp to use depending on what the operator is
  doing, shape the fingers,close them gradually as the operator is
  approaching the object etc.

  These are all complicated problems in themselves. My main goal is to
  plan the grasps, how they are used is a different problem. There are
  probably better ways of accomplishing this, this one is just a
  proof-of-concept implementation to show how the OnLinePlanner can be
  applied.
