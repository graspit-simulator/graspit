/*! The List Planner simply processes a list of grasps, computes the quality for
	each of them and then sorts the results. The list of grasps can be either
	passed in or computed on the spot by inherited versions of this class.

	Depending on the EnergyFunction used, the incoming list can be of grasps or
	pre-grasps.

	The original Primitive Planner can be re-cast as one of these. I am hoping to
	do that at some point.
