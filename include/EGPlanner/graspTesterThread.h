/*!	The GraspTesterThread is a helper class for the OnLinePlanner. It is 
	designed to have a list of possible grasps that is tests in its own
	thread. The main characteristic is that is allows external access to
	its list of "candidates": the user can place candidates in this planner's
	list, which will be tested when their turn comes. This class will place
	the results of testing in a "solution" list, where an external user
	can retrieve them from.

	How exactly the testing is being done should be more modular, right
	now it is hard-coded in. A lot of the functionality of how candidates
	are tested and solutions saved are customized for the on-line planner
	needs.
