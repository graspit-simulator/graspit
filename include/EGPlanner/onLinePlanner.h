/*  An online planner has the following characteristics:
  <ul>
  <li> runs FAST simulated annealing planning again and again
  <li> runs a tester in a separate thread that takes the solutions
  and tests them for F-C
  </ul>
  Right now it uses a SimulatedAnnealing optimization. Might use
  others in the future (Gradient Descent, Sampling etc). This
  planner ALWAYS uses a clone to perform the search. However, it
  also keeps a pointer to the initial hand (as mRefHand) in order
  to use it to receive input.

  Nothing in its structure actually defines the use of on-line
  input. However, since it always uses a clone, the initial
  reference hand is free to be controlled by the user and as a
  source of input. Wrist position input is taken into account by
  repeatedly setting the REFERENCE transform of the mCurrentState
  to the transform of the reference hand. (see the mainLoop()
  fctn). Then, as the variables in the HandObjectState will define
  OFFSETS from this state, we can use a mInputState with all
  the relevant variables set to 0. A mCurrentState with 0
  translation and 0 rotation is identical to the state of the
  mRefHand.

  For hand posture input, we process the CyberGlove - this is
  actually done up in the processInput() of the EGPlanner class.
