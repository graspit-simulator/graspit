//! A planner that will fire off child threads to investigate promising states in more detail
/*!	The GuidedPlanner is a more complicated version of the SimAnn planner. 
	It will run just like the SimAnn planner, but whenever it finds "good" 
	states it will fire of children that run in separate threads to 
	investigate the "good" states in more detail. The children will use a 
	different type of EnergyCalculator which actually closes the hand and 
	computes exact grasp quality for each state. If the time of planning 
	is not an issue (2 mins or more) this is the best planner to guarantee 
	finding exact force-closure grasps. Might be unstable due to 
	multi-threaded operation.

	States that have been sent to a child planner are remembered and 
	avoided - no point in exploring them anymore since a child planner is 
	exploring each of them in great detail.

	Whenever a child thread finishes, the main planner will take its best 
	solution and store it in its own solution list. Therefore, the list of
	solutions of the main planner (mBestList) is actually a list on 
	solutions, one from each child that has finished.

	In general, planners operating in eigengrasp space will always find
	"pre-grasps" that must usually be transformed into actual grasps by 
	closing the fingers, or doing some slightly modified version of 
	autoGrasp. The exact transformation from pre-grasp to final grasp is
	simple, but usually hidden inside the SearchEnergy class which analyzes
	pre-grasps. That class is kind of hard to understand, as it is old code
	in bad need of a shake-up.
	
	Starting in version 2.1.0, the main GuidedPlanner also stores the final
	grasp for any of its solutions. Therefore, for each solution, the best list
	of this planner will contain the pre-grasp followed by the final grasp. This
	wsa done in an attempt to make this planner usable "off the shelf" without
	having to worry about recomputing exact final grasps after its done. See the
	stopChild(...) function for details about how the solutions recovered from
	children threads are saved.
