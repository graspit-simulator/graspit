//! The parent class for each of the joint modules used in the dynamics.
/*! A dynamic joint is different from a regular Joint in that it is not
  restricted to a single degree of freedom of motion. A regular Joint
  defines a single rotation, around 1 axis, or a single translation.
  In contrast, a dynamic joint can alow motion along anything between
  0 and 6 of the degrees of freedom that are possible between two
  bodies in general. The 6 degrees of freedom that are possible between
  two bodies are rotations around the 3 axes and translations around the
  3 axes. Note that here we use the term "degree of freedom" with a
  different meaning that in the context of a robot DOF. Think of the
  DynJoint as a "generalized Joint".

  The simplest dynamic joint is the fixed one: is prohibits motion along
  all 6 possible dof's. A revolute joints only allows one rotation around
  one axis, and fixes the other 5 dofs. A universall joint allows two
  rotations, a ball joint three, etc.

  In GraspIt, dynamic joints are usually made up of the regular joints
  that they correspond to. For example, a revolute dynamic joint will
  correspond to a single regular Joint in the robot. A universall dynamic
  joint correspdonds to two regular joints, one for each axis of
  rotation, etc. In the future, it would be nice to remove this dual
  notion of regular joint / dynamic joint, but that would also mean
  getting away from defining robots in the D-H notation.

  The DynJoint has two main responsabilities: to assemble its own
  constraints for the dynamic engine, and to update the values of the
  regular joints it corresponds to after a dynamic step has been taken.
