//! A ComplexShape node for Inventor/Coin that defines an torque pointer.
/*!
  This class combines a cylinder with a circular arrow that points in a
  counter clockwise direction at the end of the cylinder.  This indicates
  a torque axis and the direction of the torque.  The length of the axis
  indiciates the magnitude of the torque.  This node makes it easy to add
  these pointers to an Inventor scene without defining the pieces separately.
  The geometry for the circular arrow has been precomputed and the binary
  Inventor data is included directly as a header file.
