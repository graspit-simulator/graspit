//! A single degree of freedom in a robot
/*! The best way to think about a DOF is as a motor, connected to one or
  multiple joints by some transmission type. It is the only way that
  an external user has at his disposal to change the joint positions of a
  robot. A single DOF must be connected to at least one joint, but can be
  connected to multiple joints as well. Currently though each joint can
  only be connected to a single DOF.

  Each DOF has a value associated with it (which usually translates directly
  to a joint angle), limits on that value, a velocity, and a generalized force
  acting on it. The simplest type of DOF has a 1-to-1 relationship with a joint
  and can be considered as a motor that only affects that joint. In this case,
  the DOF value will be equal to the joint value, and the dof limits equal to
  the joint limits.

  More complex DOF's are connected to multiple joints. In this case, depending
  on how the connection is done, different DOF's behave differently. This is the
  reason for having a hierarchy of different DOF types. The main difference is
  what happens when a joint from one DOF is stopped due to contact: how are the
  other joints of the same DOF affected? See implementations of the DOF interface
  for details.

  In static mode, the desired value of the DOF can be set directly, and then the
  DOF itself will tell you what joint values result from that value. In dynamics,
  the only way to go is to apply a force to a DOF and let the dynamic engine
  compute body motions in response. The DOF can also simulate controllers to
  create desired joint motion, although simulating better DOF controllers would
  be needed.

  the value that is had when the joint was disengaged.

  Dynamically, breakaway happens when a torque limit on breakaway joints
  is exceeded. We take that into account in the static joint torque
  computation. However, for the moment, the dynamics engine does not take
  that into account.

  This class assumes that breakaway only function in one direction, towards
  the max value of the dof. In real life this is true, as the barrett hand
  disengages finger joints only when the finger is closing. In simulation, this
