//! Base class for all robots which are collections of links connected by moveable joints
/*! A robot is collection of link bodies orgainized around a base link.
   Connected to the base link may be 1 or more kinematic chains of links and
   joints.  When a robot is attached to another robot an additional mount
   piece that connects to the base of the child robot may also be defined.
   The structure of a robot is defined in a text configuration file
   [see user documentation] that is parsed by the load method.

   Each robot has a collection of DOF's (degrees of freedom) that are
   linked to the individual joints of a kinematic chain.  In general, a robot
   can not set its joints directly. All joint motion has to be obtained from
   the DOF's then set using the kinematic chains. In general, we will refer to
   the position of the robot's base in world coordinate systems as the robot's
   "pose" while the value of the joints (and implicitly the DOF's) is the robot's
   "posture".

   To set the robot pose, think of it as a general \a WorldElement; nothing
   complicated here. Posture is more involved, and depends on whether you are
   in static or dynamic mode.

   In static mode, you can have the robot move to some desired *DOF* values. The
   DOF's will then compute appropriate joint values, and the robot will have the
   chains execute those. The settings come in two flavors:

   \a moveDOFToContacts(...) will perform the move in small steps and detect
   contacts along the way. It is guaranteed to leave your robot in a legal
   configuration, and detect all contacts that occur.

   \a forceDOFVals(...) will force the final joint values and perform no collision
   detection. Therefore, it might leave the robot in inter-penetration with some
   other object.

   If dynamics are on, then new desired DOF positions are set with a call
   to \a setDesiredDOFVals, and a number of intermediate set points are generated
   for each joint that will ensure a smooth velocity and acceleration profile.
   Built in PD DOF controllers use gains specified in the robot configuration
   file to apply approriate forces to each joint to correct error between the
   current joint position and the current set point.

   If a linear cartesian moves are desired, a trajectory generator can smoothly
   interpolate between the desired poses by creating a number of intermediate
   poses.  The inverse kinematics for each of these positions is computed and
   and the resulting joint positions are used as set points for the PD
   controllers.

  The correct way is to use writeDOFVals(...) and readDOFVals(...) which

//! A hand is a special type of robot that can have a grasp associated with it.
/*! A hand is a special type of a more generic robot.  Generally it consists of
    a palm as the base link and one or more fingers, which are kinematic
    chains.  One instance of a grasp is associated with each hand, and it is
    usually analyzed each time contacts between the hand and the object to be
    grasped change.  The hand class also provides an autograsp method which
    closes the fingers at fixed rates until further motion is prevented by
    contacts.

  This class is more the results of legacy architecture than any conceptual
  differences. Arguably, any robot is also a "hand", especially since we allow
  any robot to have multiple kinematic chains. It is possible that we will get rid
  of the Hand class altogether at some point.
