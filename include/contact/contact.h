//! A contact between 2 bodies
/*! Contacts always come in pairs.  When two bodies touch, a contact is defined
  for each of them.  They have the same (or very close to the same) global
  positions, opposite inward pointing normals, and share the same coefficients
  of friction. Any instance of this class will have as mate its reciprocal
  contact on the other body.

  A contact is defined in places where two bodies are separated by less then
  the contact threshold (usually set to 0.1 mm). In GraspIt, two bodies are
  NEVER allowed to interpenetrate; they are considered in contact if they are
  apart, but separated by less than the threshold.

  We always define contacts to occur precisely at a point (as opposed to a small
  area). This makes computations much easier, as we don't have to compute
  deformations. The Grasp class will however consider the case of objects that
  match geometry so that many point contacts can occur on the same patch. For
  soft bodies, we have the SoftContact class which inherits from this one and
  tries to approximate the frictional effects of having a contact patch (while
  not computing such a patch explicitly).

  Contacts also define their own linearized friction models. This means that,
  for each contact, friction is constrained to lie within some convex polyhedron.
  The edges that define this polyhedron are different for different types of
  contacts, which inherit from this class. However, once the edges of the friction
  polyhedron are defined, all contact behave identically.

  You will also find here code for two projects which are not used right now. The
  first one if Grasp Force Optimization (GFO). See the grasp class for that code;
  it is finished but has never been tested. Also, the GFO code has never been updated
  to work with the new Contact hierarchy of PointContact, SoftContact etc, and uses a
  parallel mechanism to keep track of friction models. The second one concerns the
  dynamics engine: in theory, we can try to save contact information from a time step
  to help the solver during the next time step. The framework is in place, but we have
  never used it.
