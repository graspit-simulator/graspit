    will leave the hand in, as it might be used by subsequent tasks.

    On startup, it will load the hand it needs, unless that hand is already
    the currently selected hand in the world. It will also load the object
    it needs. It will not delete anything from the world ar startup.

    The init and cleanup so that the world is used by subsequent tasks is
    not well-defined yet, needs more work. Exactly what initialization and 
    cleanup in the GraspIt world such a planner should do is unclear, might 
    change in the future.
