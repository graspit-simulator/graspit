//! A task is an database record of some experiment that we want to run
/*! Usually, a task will involve an object, a hand, and some sort of
    experiment, such as planning grasps and recording them in the database.
    This class encapsulates a task, plus it offers some connections so that
    the task can be run automatically by a TaskDispatcher.

    A Task is responsible for its own event management. It can use a callback
    system (i.e. surrender control and then get it back later via its own timers
    or callbacks). For example, this can be achieved by using one of the EGPlanners,
    which do that natively.

    A Task must implement the following interface:
    
    - at the beginning, the TaskDispatcher will call the start() fctn. The 
    Task must start its own event management from there. 
    
    - if the Task is one-shot, it can do all the work in start() and set its 
    status to either DONE or FAILED at the end. The Dispatcher will see this, 
    clean up and go to the next Task.

    - if the Task is event based, start() must set up the Task event loop, then 
    leave mStatus = RUNNING, and then surrender control. The Dispatcher will in
    turn surrender control and let the Task event loop do its thing.

    - when the Task is done, it is responsible for setting its own mStatus to
    DONE. The TaskDispatcher wakes up periodically and checks on this. When it
    sees that the status of the Task is DONE it will clean up and continue to
    another task.

	//! The current status of this task
	Status mStatus;
	//! The Dispatcher that started this task
	TaskDispatcher* mDispatcher;
	//! A database mgr that can be used to access the dbase
	/*! Acquired from the TaskDispatcher */

	db_planner::TaskRecord mRecord;

	//! Returns the current status of this task
	Status getStatus(){return mStatus;}

//! A high-level executive that dispatches tasks based on the contents of the database
/*! The TaskDispatcher is in charge of reading the list of tasks to be
    executed from the database, creating and startinng the appropriate
    instances of the Task class and then monitoring them.

    It can run either one-shot tasks (that do something and they're done) or even-based
    tasks which have their own callback system. In the latter case, the Dispatcher uses 
    a callback timer of its own to wake up periodically and check on the currently running 
    task.

    On exit, the Dispatcher will exit GraspIt's main loop, thus terminating the
    application. Before doing that, it will set its own status to inform the
    main app of the outcome of the tasks. It can exit because:

    - it has performed a pre-set maximum number of tasks

    - no more tasks to be executed are listed in the database

    - there was an error communicating with the database

    Note that if a Task itself finishes with an error, the Dispacther will mark that in the
    database, then proceed to the next task.
