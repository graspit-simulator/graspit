    completely, for a single body, or just between a pair of bodies.  It has
    several parameters that effect body interactions such as the table of
    coefficient of friction tables.  The world also contains methods advance
    the dynamic simulation of body motions within the world.  The state of
    a world may be written out to a simple text file which may be reloaded
