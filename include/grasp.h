//! A grasp occurs between a hand and an object and has quality measures associated with it.
//  It also has methods to optimize grasping forces.
/*! Each hand object has a grasp associated with it, and the grasp occurs
    between the hand and a graspableBody.  Each grasp is incharge of
  maintaining a set of computed grasp wrench spaces, which are then used
  by various quality measures.  When contacts change between the two, the
  grasp is updated, meaning each grasp wrench space associated with the
  grasp is rebuilt, as well as any grasp wrench space projections.  All
    grasp quality measures are also re-evaluated.

  The grasp wrench spaces are designed to be shared by different quality
  metrics. When a new metric is added, if a GWS of the needed type already
  exists in the list maintained by thhis grasp, the new QM will use it,
  and a reference count on the GWS is increased. GWS are automatically
  deleted when no QM that needs them exist anymore.

  A grasp can also perform many of the same services on set of
  VirtualCotacts (see documentation of that class for details). This part
  however has not neen competely tested, and might produce behavior that
  is not entirely consistent with how it handles traditional contacts.

  This class also provides the mechanism for performing Grasp Force
  Optimization (GFO) computations using a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation.
  There are many variants of this computation; some of them are already
  written. You can generally mix and match between optimization criteria
  and constraints in any way you want. A good starting point is the
  computeQuasistaticForcesAndTorques(...) function.
