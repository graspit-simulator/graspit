//! This class is used to evaluate a set of candidate grasps
/*!
  Given a set of candidate grasps to test, this will perform each one and
  evaluate it using a quality measure of the user's choice.  For each grasp
  it performs the following steps:
  
  - Place and orient the hand at the starting pose of the candidate grasp
  - Set the hand %DOF values to the preshape specified
  - Make sure there are no collisions with other obstacles
  - Move the hand along the approach vector until contact occurs
  - Check that there is at least on contact with the object to be grasped
  - Close the fingers until contact blocks further movement
  - Evaluate the grasp

  If it is not a force closure grasp, it moves the hand back by a small step
  and tries the grasp again.  This is repeated until a force closure grasp is
  found or a max number of back steps is reached.  The results of the
  evaluations can be saved in a text file.

  In order to allow user interaction during the testing process (it takes a
  while), an Inventor idle sensor is used to test one grasp at a time when
  the system is otherwise idle.

  This class also handles setting up the grasp visualization window which
  shows all the position and orientation of all candidate grasps with respect
  to the object or the shape primitives.  As the testing process continues,
  this is updated to show the relative quality of each evaluated grasp.

  The result after testing is a list of the force closure grasps sorted in
  quality order from best to worst.

  When the testing is complete a signal is emitted (which is why this class
  must be derived from QObject).
