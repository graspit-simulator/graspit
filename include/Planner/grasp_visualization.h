//! This class is used to create a visual representation of a candidate grasp.
/*!
  After the user generates a set of candidate grasps either automatically with
  the planner, or by reading them in from a text file,  a renderArea showing
  the shape primitves of the grasped object is opened.  For each candidate
  grasp, a grasp representation, consisting of a sphere and two arrows at right
  angles, is built in that same window.  The sphere indicates the center
  position of the palm relative to the object.  The long arrow indicates
  the palm approach direction, and the short arrow indicates the thumb
  direction.  During the testing process, the sphere representing the
  current grasp being tested is colored red.  The resulting quality of the
  grasp is used to set the relative radiius of the grasp sphere.  The higher
  the quality, the larger the sphere.
