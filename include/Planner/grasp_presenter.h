 \brief Defines the grasp_presenter class (part of grasp planner)
*/

//! This class is used to present the final list of planned grasps to the user 
/*!
  After the tester has evaluated all of the candidate grasps, the sorted list
  of good grasps is passed to this class.  Then each time the user pushes the
  show button, this class will handle presenting the next grasp in the list.
  Currently, this means that the hand in the main world/window is moved
  into the grasp configuration, and the grasp is evaluated again.  It might
  make more sense to have these presentations take place in another window, so
  as not to move elements in the main world.
