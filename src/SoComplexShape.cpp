 This implements the traversal for the SoGetMatrixAction,

 below the root node or tail of the path it is applied to.
 Therefore, we need to compute the matrix only if this group
 is in the middle of the current path chain or is off the path
 chain (since the only way this could be true is if the group
 is under a group that affects the chain).

  // SoAction has a method called "getPathCode()" that returns
  // a code indicating how this node is related to the path(s)
  // the action is being applied to. This code is one of the

  // NO_PATH    = Not traversing a path (action was applied
  //                to a node)

  //                is below the tail
  // OFF_PATH   = This node is off to the left of some node in
  //                the path chain
  //
  // If getPathCode() returns IN_PATH, it returns (in its two
  // arguments) the indices of the next nodes in the paths.
  // (Remember that an action can be applied to a list of
  // paths.)

  // to contain the number of child nodes that are in paths and
  // the indices of those children, respectively. In the other
