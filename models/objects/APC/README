This folder contains an incomplete list of object models used in Amazon Picking Challenge. Each
object has a 3D mesh file (.wrl) and texture/color file (.png).

The .xml files describe the objects and load corresponding .wrl files. The properties (material,
mass, and inertia matrix) are randomly picked as a placeholder; please fill in them carefully if
the values are useful in your simulation.

Please contact Wenzhao Lian at lianwenzhao@gmail.com if you have any questions.
