	 V-COLLIDE USER'S MANUAL - Release 1.1
	 -------------------------------------


INTRODUCTION

    The V-Collide collision detection library performs efficient and
    exact collision detection between triangulated polygonal models.  It
    uses a 2-level hierarchical approach: the top level eliminates from
    consideration pairs of objects that are not close to each other,
    while the bottom level performs exact collision detection down to
    the level of the triangles themselves.

    The basic steps involved in using this library are creating objects,
    adding sets of triangles to these objects, choosing which pairs of
    objects should be tested for collisions, setting the positions of
    the objects, performing the collision test, and getting back reports
    of the test results.  Based on these results and any other
    parameters of the simulation/interaction, the objects may be moved
    and the collisions tested again, etc.

    V-Collide is written in C++, but it provides a C interface as well.

OVERVIEW

    V-Collide is a library that provides fast, exact collision
    detection, and may be useful for virtual reality and a variety of
    other simulations applications.  It assumes that you have a model
    that may be broken down into a set of objects.  These objects
    typically undergo some rigid-body motions, and are periodically
    tested for collision.  For each simulation time step, the V-Collide
    library will report which pairs of objects are currently in
    contact.  You are free to specify exactly which pairs of objects
    should be tested for collision, and which may be ignored.

INITIALIZATION

    C++ users may initialize a collision detection engine by declaring a
    VCollide object.  It is possible to run multiple independent
    collision detection engines by simply declaring multiple VCollide
    objects.

    C users must call vcOpen(), which provides a handle to a collision
    detection engine.  This handle must then be passed as the first
    parameter to all other functions in the C interface.  vcClose()
    shuts down the collision detection engine, deallocating all space
    associated with the handle.

CREATING OBJECTS

    To create an object, first call NewObject(), which will set up an
    empty object and provide an integer ID for that object.

    For every triangle in the object, call AddTri() with the coordinates
    of its three vertices.  If the object has faces with more than three
    vertices, you will first need to triangulate them.

    When you are done adding triangles, call EndObject().  This tells
    the library to build its data structures for the object.

    The only library call which may appear between NewObject() and
    EndObject() is AddTri().

    Objects can be deleted with DeleteObject().

    You can create or delete objects at any time during the simulation,
    but building the data structures for these objects has some run-time
    overhead.

MANAGING ACTIVATION STATE

    V-Collide's activation state determines which objects will be tested
    for collisions.  The activation state has two components -- a
    per-object component and a pairwise component (for each possible
    pair of objects).  These two components are managed independently,
    so for a pair of objects to be tested for collision, not only must
    the pair be active, but each of the two objects must be active as
    well.

    When an object is created, it is active by default.  In addition,
    all pairs of objects that include this new object are also active.

    The pairwise component of the activation state is managed using the
    ActivatePair() and DeactivatePair() calls, while the per-object
    component is managed using the ActivateObject() and
    DeactivateObject() calls.  Because these components are managed
    independently, modifying an objects activation state does not affect
    the activation state of an object's pairs.

   (Note to I-Collide users: do not confuse the ActivateObject() call in
    V-Collide with the activate_full() call in I-Collide.  All the
    activation calls in I-Collide operate on the pairwise activation
    state.  I-Collide does not have a per-object activation state.)

MOVING OBJECTS

    To move an object, call UpdateTrans().  This function takes as
    arguments the ID of the object and a new transformation for it,
    expressed as a 4x4 matrix, formulated to be multiplied to the left
    of a column vector during the transformation.  This matrix should be
    a rigid-body transformation -- rotation and translation.  When an
    object is first created, it has the identity matrix as its
    transformation.

PERFORMING THE COLLISION TEST

    When all the objects' transformations have been modified as
    necessary and the activation state is properly set, call collide()
    to perform the collision testing for the current time step.

GETTING REPORTS

    Calling Report() will return the number of collisions that occurred
    in the most recent test.  Report() can also be passed a buffer and a
    buffer size limit, and the buffer will be filled with collision
    reports (of type VCReportType, defined in VCollide.[Hh]).

RETURN VALUES

    Most operations called on a VCollide engine return an integer
    success code: VC_OK on success, or an appropriate error code on
    failure.  These codes are defined in VCollide.[Hh].  Return 
    values should be checked regularly to make sure that the application
    is performing correctly.

DATA FILES

    V-Collide has no native data file format, so you are free to use to
    format of your choice.  The example code reads from several
    different file types.

CONVERTING FROM I_COLLIDE

    The high-level structure of V-Collide is similar to that of
    I-Collide, but the underlying basis is different, so shapes need to
    be described differently. V-Collide does not specify its own file
    format the way I-Collide did.  Instead, load your objects from
    whatever storage format is most convenient for you.  Then, specify
    to V-Collide every triangle in the model.

    V-Collide also differs from I-Collide in its specification of
    activation state.  V-Collide has two distinct layers of activation
    state, while I-Collide has only one.  As objects are created in
    V-Collide, they default to being active objects, and all pairwise
    interactions are also active by default.

    V-Collide does not currently support I-Collide's object instancing,
    dynamically-resized bounding boxes, or distance computations.

CONVERTING FROM RAPID

    If you are already using RAPID 2.0, you are accustomed to
    building multiple objects with the BeginObject, AddTri, EndObject
    sequence, and then explicitly testing objects pairwise for
    collisions by calling Collide(...) on each desired pair.

    V-Collide spares you the trouble of explicitly calling each pair
    by tracking potential object contact pairs for you.  So, a single call
    to a V-Collide collision detection engine will produce all objects
    in contact (but generally more efficiently than explicitly testing
    all pairs).

    V-Collide uses a similar Begin, Add, End sequence for constructing
    objects.  But RAPID users should note that all these objects
    should be added to the SAME engine if they are to be tested
    against one another (e.g. each object should not be placed in
    its own VCollide engine).
