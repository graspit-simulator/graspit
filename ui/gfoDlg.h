//! Provides an interface for running Grasp Force Optimization routines
/*! This dialog allows running some of the Grasp Force Optimization routines
  and display the results for visual inspection. The user can select the
  type of optimization to be performed; see the Grasp class for more
  details about the differences between these routines. If the optimization
  is enabled, the dialog will monitor the configuration of the hand and
  run the optimization after each change.

  The contact forces that are computed through the optimization, as well
  as the resultant object wrench, are displayed visually through contact
  force indicators at each contat plus an object wrench at the object
  origin. The contacts, as well as their forces, are also displayed in
  the contact details area in the main window. The user can click on a
  contact in this are to cause it's associated force indicator to blink.
