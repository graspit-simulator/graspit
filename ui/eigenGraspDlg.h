//! The eigengrasp dialog allows the user to see hand motion along eigengrasp dimensions
/*! This is the ui for eigengrasp movement of a hand. The main functionality
  is that the user can inspect hand motion along any eigengrasp dimension.
  However, collisions are NOT checked, either with the hand itself or with
  external object.

  The principal interface is a set of sliders, one for each eigengrasp
  dimension, that the user can manipulate. The user can also decide if the
  eigengrasp interface should be "rigid" or not, see the EigenGraspInterface
  class documentation for details.

  The user can also manipulate individual dof's as usual in GraspIt and see the
  projection of the set pose in eg space. It is also possible to make the eg
  space rigid, in which case if an individual dof is moved, the dialog will
  project the resulting pose in eg space, then project the result back in dof
  space and use it to set robot posture. In this mode, even if the user
  manipulates individual dof's, the dialog will try to find the closest
  posture in eg space that matches the desired dof posture.

  Whenever the posture of the robot is changed, this will also attempt to
  re-compute the min and max values along each eigengrasp and set slider
  limits accordingly. This unfortunately has never worked very well.

  In this dialog it is also possible to load a different set of eigengrasps
  from a file, or to set the trivial (identity) eigengrasp set. Therefore, the
  sliders themselves are not shown in the main window, but rather in a "slave"
  dialog window which is killed and reconstructed each time the eigengrasp
  interface changes.
