//! Allows the user to record grasps and save them
/*! This dialog allows the user to record grasps that have been created
  in the main GraspIt! window and then save them. For now, grasps are
  recorded as HandObjectState. Grasps can be saved to files (no dialog
  for loading them back and showing them exists yet though). If the
  CGDB is enabled, grasps can also be saved to the CGDB, with a
  tag that will distinguish them from grasps created in different
  ways. They can then be played back with the usual CGDB browser.

  The CGDB save option will be enabled only if a sucessful connection
  to the CGDB has already been opened (use the Connect and Browse menu
  for that). If not, only the option to save grasps to a file, in some
  arbitrary ascii format, is available.

  This is still very crude, and some of the parameters of the grasps
  that are stored in the CGDB are hard-coded in rather than input by
  the user through the dialog. However, it can serve as a starting
  point if you need to write better code for saving grasps to the
  database.

  The class manages its own quality measures so that we make sure
  we have consistency between runs, and also to make sure we have the
  exact same data that we store in the CGDB for other grasps.
