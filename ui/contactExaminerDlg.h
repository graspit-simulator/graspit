//! Dialog for creating, saving, loading and inspecting virtual contacts
/*! This dialog enables a user to create virtual contacts on a hand, save
  them to a file, load virtual contacts from the file and inspect them.
  It needs a hand and an actual object; the user must create traditional
  contacts between the hand and the object, then use this dialog to mark
  them as virtual. The contacts then continue to exist as virtual contacts
  even after the object has been moved away. The newly created virtual
  contacts can then be saved to a file, or previously saved virtual contacts
  can be loaded from a file.

  This dialog can also be used to compute a "virtual" grasp quality of
  all the virtual contacts on the hand, without need for an object. However,
  this functionality has not been tested recently. Overall, this dialog
  is in need of a re-design.

  The same functionality can be applied to objects: you can load an object,
  mark contacts as virtual ot just load pre-saved virtual contacts from
  a file, and then compute grasp quality without needing a hand at all.

  WARNING: this is code under construction, not very robust.
